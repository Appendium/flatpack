Paul Zepernick and ObjectLab are pleased to announce release 3.1.0 of
FlatPack for Java 1.4+.

FlatPack is the new name for PZFileReader as the project has outgrown
the initial scope of reading files...

Open Source flat file parser (CSV, Fixed Length, Custom) using XML 
to configure formats.

http://flatpack.sourceforge.net

This is an important release with a new name and package structure.
Users of previous version should find it easy to migrate as most classes
have kept their original name.

A major development is the experimental release of writers for exporting
DataSets. We would like to thank Dirk and Holger from the Mule Project
for their kind contribution to FlatPack. We're looking forward to the
result of using FlatPack in Mule, a great Open Source ESB.

This release also adds a few convenience methods on a DataSet.

FlatPack is released under the business friendly Apache License v2.0.

The library is small, lightweight and does not force you to adopt a
framework.

The implementation is useful to any business that deal with flat files.
Not only it can parse very quickly some CSV or any-user defined delimiter,
this library can parse FIXED LENGTH files.

The library allow you to define an XML mapping (or in a database) of
the format of your file. Once this is done, the parsed data can be accessed
via a simple name lookup mechanism.

It is our aim to publish at some point some well know file formats for
your immediate use. Please contribute if you have some standard files...

It is available for download via SourceForge or the Maven Central
Repository (both Maven 1 and Maven 2). The homepage has some very 
quick examples.

ObjectLab is not new to the open-source community having used numerous OS 
projects, It has recently launched the ObjectLab Kit family, including:
- QALab (http://qalab.sourceforge.net), a tool that keeps track over-time
  of the static analysis results from FindBugs, Checkstyle, PMD, Cobertura etc.
- DateCalculators (http://objectlabkit.sourceforge.net), a set of generic
  lightweight and thread-safe Date calculators for Business and Finance.
- JTreeMap, (http://jtreemap.sourceforge.net), probably the only Java Open 
  Source implementation of treemap/heatmaps, available as a Swing or SWT
  component.
- StatSVN, (http://www.statsvn.org), statistics for your Subversion repo.

We would like to thanks our friends and colleagues for their help, 
reviews and suggestions.

Sorry for the long email... 

Feel free to pass on to people who may be interested.

Enjoy!!
