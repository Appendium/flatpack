Paul Zepernick and ObjectLab are pleased to announce release 2.3.0 of
PZFileReader for Java 1.4+.

Open Source flat file parser (CSV, Fixed Length, Custom) using XML 
to configure formats.

http://pzfilereader.sourceforge.net

PZFileReader is released under the business friendly Apache License v2.0.

It is available immediately for download via SourceForge or the Maven Central
Repository (both Maven 1 and Maven 2). The homepage has some very 
quick examples.

The library is small, lightweight and does not force you to adopt a
framework.

The implementation is useful to any business that deal with flat files.
The library allow you to define an XML mapping (or in a database) of
the format of your file. Once this is done, the parsed data can be accessed
via a simple name lookup mechanism.

It is our aim to publish at some point some well know file formats for
your immediate use.

ObjectLab is not new to the open-source community having used numerous OS 
projects, It has recently launched the ObjectLab Kit family, including:
- QALab (http://qalab.sourceforge.net), a tool that keeps track over-time
  of the static analysis results from FindBugs, Checkstyle, PMD, Cobertura etc.
- DateCalculators (http://objectlabkit.sourceforge.net), a set of generic
  lightweight and thread-safe Date calculators for Business and Finance.
- JTreeMap, (http://jtreemap.sourceforge.net), probably the only Java Open 
  Source implementation of treemap/heatmaps, available as a Swing or SWT
  component.
 
We would like to thanks our friends and colleagues at XXXX for their help, 
reviews and suggestions.

Sorry for the long email... 

Feel free to pass on to people who may be interested.

Enjoy!!
