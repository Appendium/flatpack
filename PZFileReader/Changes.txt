Version 1.0.3
-----------------------------------	
2-5-2005
		-added methods to set data in DataSet to all lower or all upper case setLowerCase(), setUpperCase()

		-Changed the OrderBy class to make sure the elements being compared were the same case, so as not to make
		case a factor when comparing.  If they are not the same case elements are converted to lower before comparing.
		
		-Added setLowerCase() and setUpperCase(0 to Java Docs


Version 1.0.2
-----------------------------------		
1-27-2005
	
		-Changed parsing logic for delimited files with text qualifiers.  The parser will now parse lines that are qualified
		and not qualified.  For example:
		"here",1234,"test",50,test	
		This will now parse into 5 seperate columns.  However if the text contains a delimiter or seperator inside the text,
		it must be qualified to work correctly.



Version 1.0.1
-----------------------------------

1-23-2005:
		-Fixed bug in delimted parse.  If no elements were found
		in a line, a string index out of bounds exception was thrown.
		
		-Added getDate(String,SimpleDateFormat).  By default, the current getDate(String) method
		was expecting the date in yyyyMMdd format.  This method allows for another date format to be
		specified.  This format should match the format in the text file.  If you would like to change the
		formating of the date after it is returned from the DataSet, you can use SimpleDateFormat.format(Date)
		
		-Corrected javadocs for the getDate methods.  Had return type of double, changed to Date.
		
		-Added samples
